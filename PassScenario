Pass Scenario

You are an invited speaker at a conference in the United States. The conference venue is a casino in Las Vegas and therefore requires you to present ID that provides proof of age so that you are legally able to enter the premises.

The entry is gated with automatic scanners that read the venue patron's driver's licenses, unfortunately your driver's license is not issued by one of the states of the three countries in the USMCA free-trade zone (formerly NAFTA), the USA, Mexico, and Canada. Your license issued by a foreign government will not register as a valid ID by the scanner.

There's a long queue to get into the venue and you are scheduled to give one of the early talks.

After some observation you realise that you might be able to get through the security checkpoint more quickly.

The automatic license scanners are slow because they're having trouble detecting which licenses have all required fields. The expected fields are as follows:

    "born" - year of birth
    "issued" - year license was issued
    "expires" - year license will expire
    "height" - license holder's heigh either in inches or centimeters
    "hair" - license holder's hair colour
    "eyes" - license holder's eye colour
    "usmca" - license number
    "state" - two character state or territory abbreviation

License data is validated in batch files (inside the "data" subdirectory). Each license is represented as a sequence of key:value pairs separated by spaces or newlines. Records are separated by blank lines.

Here is an example batch file containing four licenses:

eyes:gray usmca:860023327 expires:2025 hair:#ffff73
born:1937 issued:2022 state:LA height:183cm

issued:2017 eyes:amber state:BC expires:2028 usmca:028348884
hair:#cf907a born:1929

hair:#ac16e1 issued:2018
expires:2029
eyes:brown usmca:760653108 born:1931
height:179cm

hair:#cfb07d expires:2030 usmca:164559648
issued:2016 eyes:brown height:59in

The first license is valid - all eight fields are present. The second license is invalid - it is missing the "height" field.

The third license is interesting; the only missing field is "state", so it looks like a foreign license! Surely, nobody would mind if you made the system temporarily ignore missing "state" fields. Treat this "license" as valid.

The fourth license is missing two fields, "state" and "born". Missing state is fine, but missing any other field is not, so this license is invalid.

According to the above rules, your improved system would report 2 valid licenses.



Your programs should count the number of valid licenses - those that have all required fields. Treat "state" as optional.

Ensure that you validate the licenses as follows:

    Ensure that all of the required fields are in each record
        ie. You will need to ensure that seven of the eight requirements above are met (remember that you are going to make the reader "ignore" the state ID)
    Verify that the license holder is 21 years or older (the legal requirement to enter the venue)
    Ensure that the license has not been issued with a future year
    Ensure that the license was not issued more that ten years ago
    Ensure that the license has not expired
    Ensure that the license does not have an expiry date more than 10 years into the future
    Parse the person's height and ensure that they are between the following bounds:
        height must be between 150 and 193 cm inclusive, OR
        height must be between 59 and 76 inches inclusive
    Ensure that the hair colour is HTML color code:
        A valid HTML color code is a six digit hexadecimal value that begins with a '#'
    Also check the eye colour, valid eye colours are:
        Amber "amber"
        Blue "blue"
        Brown "brown"
        Grey "gray" (note the US spelling)
        Green "green"
        Hazel "hazel"
        Other "other"
    Valid license numbers are a 9 digit decimal number

Your output should be structured as follows:

    print each validated record separate by a dashed line
    print the count of validated records separated by a double-dashed line

The provided sample input should produce the following output (note that the order of the fields may vary, that's okay)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{expires=2025, hair=#ffff73, born=1937, usmca=860023327, state=LA, issued=2022, eyes=gray, height=183cm}
